# Tweeter

This is the completed twitter clone I made as part of the BYU CS340 Software Design class.

Tech Stack:
React/Typescript, AWS Lambdas, AWS DynamoDB

# Notes

/tweeter-server contains the backend code that is meant to run on AWS

/tweeter-shared contains classes that define object structure for functionality and data transfer

/tweeter-web contains the front end react component code as well as front end logic

The lambdas are currently shut down
