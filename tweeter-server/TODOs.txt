* finish implementing/validating auth token logic 
    - possibly a parent class with validateToken() func that checks the auth table to see if the token is in the table and not expired
    - find all the places where the authtoken wasn't being checked and add the logic for checking the auth token

* logout function
* follow and unfollow functions after authtoken is finished being implemented
* general code clean up and testing
