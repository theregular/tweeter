* general code clean up and testing with authtoken 

* change timeout back to 3 seconds on tweeterRegister lambda? (Possibly doing too much in one func)
* timeout on login lambda also changed to be more than 3 secs

* FIXED - LOGIN allows logins even with wrong password

* REGISTER allows creation of new user even if that alias is already taken
* problem rendering followers/followees count for users until follow button is clicked

* FIXED - make follower / followee count just stored as data in the user table

* make it so when a user is followed or unfollowed the data is update through the SQS queues instead of directly in the table?
